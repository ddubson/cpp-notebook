## Variables

### Declaring

To declare a variable is to define it in the program.
In C++, you must provide the type of the variable first

```c++
int counter;
```

### Initializing

To initialize a variable is to bind it to a value;

```c++
// Declare and initialize
int counter = 0;

// Initialize after declaration
int counter;
counter = 0;
```
